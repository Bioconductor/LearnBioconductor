# Learning R / Bioconductor for Sequence Analysis

This package contains training material for a Fall, 2014 introductory
_R_ / _Bioconductor_ course "Learning _R_ / _Bioconductor_ for Sequence
Analysis", offered October 27-29, Seattle, WA.

This course is directed at beginning and intermediate users who
would like an introduction to the analysis and comprehension of
high-throughput sequence data using _R_ and _Bioconductor_. Day 1 focuses
on learning essential background: an introduction to the _R_ programming
language; central concepts for effective use of _Bioconductor_ software;
and an overview of high-throughput sequence analysis work flows. Day 2
emphasizes use of _Bioconductor_ for specific tasks: an RNA-seq
differential expression work flow; exploratory, machine learning, and
other statistical tasks; gene set enrichment; and annotation.  Day 3
transitions to understanding effective approaches for managing larger
challenges: strategies for working with large data, writing re-usable
functions, developing reproducible reports and work flows, and
visualizing results.

The course combines lectures with extensive hands-on practicals;
students are required to bring a laptop with wireless internet access
and a modern version of the Chrome or Safari web browser.
