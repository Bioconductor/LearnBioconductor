# Learning R / Bioconductor for Sequence Analysis

This package contains training material for a Winter, 2014 introductory
_R_ / _Bioconductor_ course "Learning _R_ / _Bioconductor_ for Sequence
Analysis", offered February 2-3, Genentech, San Francisco, CA.

This course is directed at beginning and intermediate users who would
like an introduction to the analysis and comprehension of
high-throughput sequence data using _R_ and
_[Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org)_. Day 1 focuses on learning
essential background: an introduction to the _R_ programming language;
central concepts for effective use of _Bioconductor_ software; and an
overview of high-throughput sequence analysis work flows. The morning
of Day 2 emphasizes use of _Bioconductor_ for specific tasks, and in
particular takes detailed look at RNA-seq differential expression work
flow.  The afternoon of Day 2 transitions to understanding effective
approaches for managing larger challenges: strategies for working with
large data, writing re-usable functions, developing reproducible
reports and work flows, and visualizing results.

The course combines lectures with extensive hands-on practicals;
participants are required to bring a laptop with wireless internet
access and a modern version of the Chrome or Safari web browser.
