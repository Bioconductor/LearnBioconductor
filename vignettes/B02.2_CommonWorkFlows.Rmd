# Common Sequence Analysis Work Flows

## RNA-seq

See the [lecture notes](B02.1_RNASeq.html) and [lab](B02.1_RNASeqLab.html).

RNA-seq differential expression of known _genes_

- Simplest scenario
- Experimental design: simple, replicated; track covariates and be
  aware of batch effects
- Sequencing: moderate length and number of reads; single or
  paired-end (though probably paired-end).
- Alignment: basic splice-aware aligner, e.g., _Bowtie2_,
  _STAR_. Viable _Bioconductor_ approaches: `r Biocpkg("Rsubread")`,
  `r Biocpkg("Rbowtie")` (especially via the `r Biocpkg("QuasR")`
  package).
- Reduction: `GenomicRanges::summarizeOverlaps()` or external tools,
  using gene model from `TxDb.*` package or GFF / GTF files. End
  result: matrix of counts.
- Analysis: `r Biocpkg("DESeq2")`, `r Biocpkg("edgeR")`, and
  additional software.
  
RNA-seq differential expression of known and novel _transcripts_

- Popular non-_R_ work flow: _Rbowtie2_, _tophat_, _cufflinks_, _cuffdiff_.
- _Biocondutor_ options
    
    - `r Biocpkg("DEXSeq")`: differential _exon_ use.
    - `Rsubread::subjunc()` for aligning without requiring known gene models.
    - `r Biocpkg("cummeRbund")`: working with _cufflinks_ output.

Single-cell expression

- `r Biocpkg("monocle")`

## ChIP-seq

See my recent
[slides](http://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/CSAMA2014/4_Thursday/lectures/ChIPSeq_slides.pdf)
outlining ChIP-seq and relevant _Bioconductor_ software.

- Experimental design / wet lab: important to effectively enrich
  genomic DNA via ChIP, otherwise hard to distinguish signal peaks from background
- Sequencing: moderate length and number of single-end reads very adequate.
- Alignment: Basic aligners sufficient
- Reduction

    - External software; many tools depending on application, e.g., _MACS_.
    - Product: BED and / or WIG files of called peaks

- Analysis & Comprehension

    - `r Biocpkg("ChIPQC")` for quality control.
    - `r Biocpkg("rtracklayer")` to input BED and WIG files to
      standard _Bioconductor_ data structures.
    - `r Biocpkg("ChIPpeakAnno")`, `r Biocpkg("ChIPXpres")` for
      annotating peaks in relation to genes.
    - `r Biocpkg("DiffBind")` to assess differential representation of
      peaks in a designed experiment.
    - `r Biocpkg("AnnotationHub")` for accessing (some)
      consortium-level summary data.

## Copy Number

Experimental design

- Duplications or deletions larger than 1 kb
- Germ line (primarily diploid genome, homogeneous sample, integer
  copy numbers) or somatic variants?
- Tumor / normal pairs?

Assays

- aCGH, SNP, and other arrays (`r Biocpkg("CGHbase")`, 
  `r Biocpkg("crlmm")`, `r Biocpkg("CopyNumber450K")`)
- Low or high-coverage; exome or whole-genome sequencing.

Reduction

- Bin and count. GC and other (e.g., exon length) correction. Easily
  and efficiently done with, e.g., `GenomicRanges::tileGenome()` and
  `r Biocpkg("GenomicFiles")`.
- Segment -- circular binary segmentation (often via 
  `r Biocpkg("DNAcopy")`), HMM

Analysis & comprehension

- 45 packages tagged with "CopyNumberVariation" in
  [biocViews](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___CopyNumberVariation); also terms "DNASeq", "ExomeSeq", "WholeGenome"
- Represent duplicated regions as genomic ranges; integrates very
  easily in _Bioconductor_ annotation work flows.

## Variants

See Michael Lawrence's variant calling with
[VariantTools](http://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/BioC2014/Lawrence_Tutorial.pdf).
and Val Obenchain's manipulation and annotation of called variants with
[VariantAnnotation](http://bioconductor.org/help/workflows/variants/).

- Sequencing: requires high-quality reads with high per-nucleotide
  depth of coverage -- longer, paired-end sequencing.
- Alignment: requires effective aligners; _BWA_, _GMAP_, ...

    - `r Biocpkg("gmapR")` wraps the GMAP aligner in _R_.
    
- Reduction: typically to VCF files summarizing variants and / or
  population-level variation. _GATK_ and other non-_R_ tools commonly
  used.
  
    - `r Biocpkg("VariantTools")` includes facilities for calling
      variants.
    - `r Biocpkg("h5vc")` targets a different intermediate step:
      summarize base counts at each position in the genome; use this
      as a starting point for calling variants, and to evaluate false
      positives, etc.
      
- Analysis & comprehension

    - `r Biocpkg("VariantAnnotation")`, `r Biocpkg("ensemblVEP")` for
      querying / inputting VCF files, and for annotation of variants
      ("is this a coding variant?", etc.).
    - `r Biocpkg("SomaticSignatures")` for working with somatic
      signatures of single-nucleotide variants.

## Epigenomics

See the short
[introduction](http://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/Epigenomics/MethylationArrays.html)
and
[lab](http://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2014/Epigenomics/MethylationArrays-lab.html)
centered around Illumina 450k methylation arrays and the `r Biocpkg("minfi")` package.

- Analysis & comprehension: `r Biocpkg("bsseq")`, `r Biocpkg("BiSeq")`
  for processing and analysis; `r Biocpkg("bumphunter")` as basic tool
  for identifying CpG features.

## Microbiome

- Experimental design: typically population-level surveys with
  moderate (10's-100's) of samples.
- Wet lab & sequencing: often target phylogenetically-informative
  genes, requiring longer (overlapping) paired-end reads. Many
  existing studies used 454 technology, which has a different
  sequencing error model than Illumina (e.g., homopolymers are a
  common error, instead of trailing nucleotide quality deterioration).
- Reduction: Pre-processing (e.g., knitting together overlapping
  paired-end reads) and taxonomic classification / placement in
  third-party software, e.g., _QIIME_, _pplacer_. End result: count
  table summarizing represenation of distinct taxa in each sample.
  
    - `r Biocpkg("rRDP")` provides an _R_ / _Bioconductor_ interface
      to the RDP classifiere.

- Analysis: _R_ / _Bioconductor_ and many insights from microarray /
  RNA-seq analysis well suited to count table, but common pipelines
  have re- or dis-invented the wheel.
  
    - `r Biocpkg("phyloseq")` provides very nice tools for general
      analysis.
