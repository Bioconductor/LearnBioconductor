# Copy number work flow

Sonali Arora, Martin Morgan<br/>
October 28, 2014

Copy Number Variation (CNV's) refers to the duplication or deletion of
DNA segments larger than 1 kb. CNV's are structural variations in the
genome which range in length between 50 bp and 1 Mbp. They are
widespread among humans - on an average 12 CNVs exist per individual
in comparison to the reference genome. They have also been shown to
play a role in diseases such as autism, breast cancer, obesity,
Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia among other diseases.

## Experimental design

Like any other genomic analysis, before we start a copy Number
analysis, we need to consider experimental design. Here, we highlight
two specific pointers that one needs to keep in mind while designing a
copy number analysis.

**Tumor and normal samples** Are we planning to just find copy number
profile in individuals? For example, how does the copy number profile
for a region evolve over a certain period of time? (Here we are
comparing the copy number profile to a reference genome)

Are we planning to compare copy number profiles from tumor vs normal
profiles?  For example, we may be trying to find out if copy number
changes are responsible for a certain form of cancer and want to find
the exact genomic region against which a treatment can be developed.

There are different packages and different functions inside the same
package which handle CNV for tumor and normal samples or CNV in
samples.

**Germ line versus somatic CNV** Germ line CNV are relatively short
(a few bp to a few Mbp) copy number changes that the individual
inherits from one of the two parental gametes and thus are typically
present in 100% of cells.

Somatic CNV (often called CNA where A stands for alterations or aberration) are
copy number changes of any size and amount (from a few bases to whole 
chromosomes) that happen (and often carry on happening) in cancer cells. 
Cancer cells can be aneuploid (that means they are largely triploid, 
tetraploid or even aploid) and can have high focal amplifications 
(some regions could have many copies: it is not unusual to have 8-12 copies for 
some regions). Furthermore, because tumor samples are typically an admixture 
of normal and cancer cells, the tumor purity in unknown and variable. 

Different algorithms make different assumptions while handling somatic
or germ line CNV. Typically, germ line cnv caller can assume:

- The genome is largely diploid.
- The sample is pure and homogeneous.
- Any gain or loss should be 50% move or 50% less coverage.

For these reasons, the algorithms can focus more on associating
_p_-values for each call; it is possible to estimate false positive
and false negative rates.

Somatic CNA callers cannot make any of the assumption above, or if
they do, they have limited scope.
  
## Sequencing technology

Some key questions when thinking about sequencing technology to use
include:

+   What kind of sequencing data are we working with? 

    Is it array CGH data, SNP array or next generation sequencing
    data? For example, the `r Biocpkg("CGHbase")` detects CNV's in
    array CGH data whereas the `r Biocpkg("seqCNA")` among others
    detects CNV's in high-throughput sequencing data.
  
+   Amount of genome being sequenced - whole genome vs exome?

    Are we looking for copy number across the whole genome or are we
    looking for copy number only in exomes? Again different packages
    handle different kind of sequencing data. For example, The
    _Bioconductor_ package `r Biocpkg("exomeCopy")` detects CNV in
    exome sequencing data whereas the _Bioconductor_ package 
    `r Biocpkg("cn.mops")` detects CNV in whole genome sequencing data.
  
+   Which platform was the sequencing done on?

    A lot of packages detecting CNV on platform-specific data. 
    For example, the `r Biocpkg("crlmm")` detects CNV's in Affymetrix SNP 5.0 
    and 6.0 and Illumina arrays whereas the `r Biocpkg("CopyNumber450K")` 
    detects them in Illumina 450k methylation microarrays. 
  
+   What is the coverage of sequenced data?

    Most packages work well with high coverage sequencing data, but
    some packages are designed to work well with low coverage data. It
    is best to recognize how coverage of our data will affect the
    choice of the package we use for our analysis at an early stage.
    
## Copy number analysis algorithm?
    
Since statistics plays a huge role in copy number analysis, we should
also spend some time in thoroughly understanding the underlying
algorithm of the _R_ package being used. A few questions to consider
while choosing a package would be -

1. How is our chosen package binning and counting reads?

2. Is any pre-processing required from our end? Is it trimming aligned
   reads internally?

3. What segmentation algorithm is being used ? For example, does the
   package use Circular Binary Segmentation, HMM based methods etc.

4. How efficiently can it handle big data? Do I need additional
   computational resources to run the analysis? Does the function run
   in parallel?
  
## Available resources in _Bioconductor_ 

_Bioconductor_ currently has about 41 packages for Copy Number
Analysis.  To find these, one can visit the
[biocViews](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/BiocViews.html#___Software.)
page and type "CopyNumberVariation" in the "Autocomplete biocViews
search"

## Workflow using _cn.mops_

Lets work through a small example to illustrate how straight-forward a
copy number analysis can be once you've figured out all the
logistics. We will also find the genes that lie within the detected
copy number regions.

For this analysis, I chose the `r Biocpkg("cn.mops")` package as it
helps us with

- Detecting germ-line CNVs
- Works well with low coverage data 
- Handles both single copy number analysis and tumor vs normal copy
  number analysis
- Uses parallel processing internally so we get fast computation
- Handles whole genome sequencing data
- Supports _GenomicRanges_ infrastructure which allows easy workflows
  with other Bioconductor packages.

We start by downloading relevant files, if necessary

```{r cvn-setup-1, echo=FALSE}
destdir <- "~/bigdata"
if (!file.exists(destdir))
    dir.create(destdir)
```

```{r cnv-setup-2, message=FALSE}
## set path/to/download/directory, e.g.,
## destdir <- "~/bam/copynumber"
stopifnot(file.exists(destdir))

bamFiles <- file.path(destdir,
                      c("tumorA.chr4.bam", "normalA.chr4.bam"))
urls <- paste0("http://s3.amazonaws.com/copy-number-analysis/",
               basename(bamFiles))
for (i in seq_along(bamFiles))
    if (!file.exists(bamFiles[i])) {
        download.file(urls[i], bamFiles[i])
        download.file(paste0(urls[i], ".bai"), paste0(bamFiles[i], ".bai"))
    }
```

The main work flow 1) loads the library; 2) counts reads; 3)
normalizes counts; 4) detects CNVs; and 5) visualizes results.

```{r cnv-workflow, message=FALSE}
## 1. Load the cn.mops package
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
    library(cn.mops)
})

## 2. We can bin and count the reads
reads_gr <- getReadCountsFromBAM(BAMFiles = bamFiles,
    sampleNames = c("tumor", "normal"),
    refSeqName = "chr4", WL = 10000, mode = "unpaired")

## 3. Noramlization
## We need a special normalization because the tumor has many large CNVs
X <- normalizeGenome(reads_gr, normType="poisson")

## 4. Detect cnv's
ref_analysis <- referencecn.mops(X[,1], X[,2],
     norm=0, 
     I = c(0.025, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64), 
     classes = paste0("CN", c(0:8, 16, 32, 64, 128)),
     segAlgorithm="DNAcopy")
resCNMOPS <- calcIntegerCopyNumbers(ref_analysis)

## 5. Visualize the cnv's
segplot(resCNMOPS)
```

Here the x-axis represents the genomic position and the y-axis
represents the log ratio of read counts and copy number call of each
segment (red)

```{r cnv-regions}
human_cn <- cnvr(resCNMOPS)
human_cn
```

To find the genes that lie in these copy number regions, we will use
the _TranscriptDb_ object for hg19

```{r cnv-annotate-txdb, message=FALSE}
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
## subset to work with only chr4
txdb <- keepSeqlevels(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene, "chr4")
genes0 <- genes(txdb)
## 'unlist' so that each range is associated with a single gene identifier
idx <- rep(seq_along(genes0), elementLengths(genes0$gene_id))
genes <- granges(genes0)[idx]
genes$gene_id = unlist(genes0$gene_id)
```

Next we will use find overlaps to assign gene identifiers to cnv
regions.

```{r cnv-annotate}
olaps <- findOverlaps(genes, human_cn, type="within")
idx <- factor(subjectHits(olaps), levels=seq_len(subjectLength(olaps)))
human_cn$gene_ids <- splitAsList(genes$gene_id[queryHits(olaps)], idx)
human_cn
```

## Session info

The packages and versions used in this work flow are as follows:

```{r cvn-session-info}
restoreSeqlevels(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
sessionInfo()
```
